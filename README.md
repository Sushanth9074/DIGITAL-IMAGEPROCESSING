# Image Processing Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python programs for basic image processing tasks using various libraries such as OpenCV, Matplotlib, and PIL. Each program is designed to demonstrate specific image processing techniques and functions.

## Programs Included:

1. **Read, Display, and Save Image Using Various Libraries:**
   - Reads an image using OpenCV, PIL, and Matplotlib.
   - Converts the image to grayscale using different libraries.
   - Displays the image using OpenCV, PIL, and Matplotlib.
   - Saves the grayscale images.

2. **Image Attributes:**
   - Retrieves and displays information about an image, including height, width, number of channels, and separates RGB channels.

3. **Resize, Rotate, and Convert Image:**
   - Resizes and rotates an image using PIL.
   - Converts the original image to binary.

4. **Display Image Attributes:**
   - Utilizes PIL and OpenCV to extract and display attributes of an image, such as width, height, number of channels, image type, and shape.

5. **Arithmetic and Logical Operations on Image:**
   - Performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two images.
   - Performs logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) on two images.

6. **Image Processing Operations:**
   - Image slicing.
   - Blending of images using masks, filters, and blur functions.
   - Cropping.
   - Generating the negative of an image.
   - Drawing on an image.
   - Basic statistics of an image.

7. **Edge Detection:**
   - Canny Edge Detection.
   - Sobel Edge Detection.
   - Prewitt Edge Detection.
   - Laplacian Edge Detection.

8. **Thresholding:**
   - Global thresholding.
   - Local (adaptive) thresholding.

9. **Histogram Equalization:**
   - Histogram equalization without using a function.
   - Histogram equalization using the built-in function.

10. **Image Resampling:**
    - Downsamples and upsamples an image.

11. **Median and Mean Filters:**
    - Applies median and mean filters to an image.

12. **Batch Processing:**
    - Iterates through all image files in a directory, applies rotation and resizing transformations, and displays the results.

## How to Use:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the programs individually to see the results of each image processing task.
- Modify the programs as needed for your specific use case.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use these programs for your image processing projects!
